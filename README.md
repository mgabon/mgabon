**Hi there 👋 i'm Mark, a Jr. Fullstack Web Developer.**

In 2021, I dropped out of college to invest all my time in coding and took a chance to learn new skills in BloomTech.

I've always been a curious person my entire life. Creating things from scratch and solving complex problems excite me.

Learning new skills have been challenging, but rewarding. I look to the day where I can apply my skills to proceed in this diverse field.

📌 I'm currently working on database structures and functional web applications.

📚️ I want to improve on my technical skills.

👨‍💻 I'm looking to collaborate on a e-commerce web application.

💬 Ask me about basketball or anime and we'll be friends.

⚡️ Fun fact: English was the second language I learned.
